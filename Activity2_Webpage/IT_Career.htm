      <h1>IT Career</h1>
      <p>
         I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Nebraska at Omaha studying Management of Information Systems. My degree program focuses in the area of Information Assurance. Along with my full-time path at UNO, I am also a part-time IT intern at a company called Burlington Capital. As an intern, I help with project completion in various areas such as network topology, Microsoft Administration, and much more. On top of getting to experience large operations first-hand, I also help out with day-to-day desktop support. Support tast may include user security delegation, password resets, account creation/deletion, and a lot of hardware upgrades. My career in IT so far has been very eye-opening and beneficial for me. I get to work with great people and I learn something new every day. I am excited to see what my future holds in Information Technology!
